# LIA Linux Project – Network Services & Monitoring

## Project Details
- **Student:** Muhammad Adnan  
- **Supervisor:** Daniel Thyselius  
- **LIA location:** Mindful Stack AB  
- **Course:** NÄTD24LIN_LIA140  
- **Duration:** 6 weeks (40 yhp)  
- **GitHub Repository:** [Lia-Linux-Project](https://github.com/muhad308/Lia-Linux-Project)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a secure, service-rich Linux platform that delivers core network services (SSH, DHCP, DNS), logging, and monitoring capabilities using Zabbix. It was developed during the LIA internship using Ubuntu Server and Client VMs on VirtualBox.

All services and configurations are documented, tested, and version-controlled via GitHub. This platform simulates a small business environment with central server monitoring and auto-alerting features.

Why is this important?
Businesses need reliable network services (like IP assignment, DNS, and logging).

A centralized Linux server reduces manual work and improves security.

## Objectives
- **Set Up Virtual Server**: Deploy Ubuntu Server 24.04 on VirtualBox
- **Configure Network Services**: Implement DHCP, DNS, Syslog, and Zabbix
- **Enhance Security**: Utilize SSH keys, UFW firewall, and Fail2Ban
- **System Monitoring**: Employ Zabbix for real-time monitoring and alerts
- **Version Control**: Use Git and GitHub for tracking configurations and scripts

---

## Services Implemented

- **DHCP Server**  
  Automatically assigns IP addresses to client machines, reducing manual configuration errors.

- **DNS Server (BIND9)**  
  Resolves internal hostnames to IP addresses, facilitating easier network navigation.

- **Syslog (rsyslog)**  
  Collects and centralizes logs from multiple machines, aiding in troubleshooting and auditing.

- **Logrotate**  
  Manages log file sizes by rotating and archiving logs, ensuring disk space is conserved.

- **Zabbix Monitoring**  
  Monitors system performance and services, sending alerts for any anomalies detected.

- **SSH Key Login**  
  Provides secure remote access, mitigating risks associated with password-based logins.

- **UFW Firewall**  
  Controls incoming and outgoing traffic, adding a layer of security to the server.

- **Fail2Ban**  
  Protects against brute-force attacks by banning IPs with multiple failed login attempts.

## Configuration Files

### DHCP Configuration
- `dhcpd.conf`: DHCP server configuration

### DNS Configuration
- `named.conf.local`: DNS server configuration (for internal zone)

## Scripts
Two automation scripts have been implemented:
1. **Backup Script**: Daily backup of configuration files to the Git repository.
2. **Service Status Check**: Checks the status of critical services and logs output to syslog.

### Zabbix**
- Active network and resource monitoring
